# Landing Page Project

In this project, the program does the follows:

1. Dynamically builds the TOP Navigation based on the Sections  (Section 1 , 2, 3 etc)

2. On click on Section, it scrolls to appropriate section

3. The Section actively being viewed has "class=active-class" added dynamically

4. The section scrolled to gets appropriately highlighted
